INTRODUCING CENUN DEFI

Cenun is a Defi based Yield Farming Platform that optimizes the staking mechanism
Cenun utilizes Web3 protocols, wherein users are afforded the opportunity to engage in token staking. By committing their tokens to a smart contract, users secure the capacity to recurrently redeem a "reCenun" utility token. This redemption process may be iteratively pursued until the exhaustion of reCenun in the claim pool. This cenun ecosystem elegantly intertwines staking mechanics with token issuance, underscoring the dynamic interplay between liquidity provision and resource acquisition, all orchestrated within a self-executing and tamper-resistant blockchain framework.

in regards to cenun staking, the protocol allows users to stake Cenun tokens and in return, users can redeem or claim reCenun(Cenun Governance Token) and as well as still having their Cenun tokens intact. Measures such as locking staked tokens could be implemented to avoid users selling off tokens easily and drive the price of Cenun up

A certain amount of reCenun is deposited in the claim pool while the rest is added as liquidity to enable trade. This is to enable transparency amongst the community by ensuring the tokens are community driven. More utilities such as NFTs could be issued to holders of the Governance token as well as the using reCenun tokens for voting for proposals in the Cenun protocol.


TESTING CENUN DEFI

The Cenun Faucet is deployed and integrated into the dapp for testers/users to get CENUN tokens and stake. The process is straight forward,

STEP ONE:
 users have to connect wallet and network should be set at Alfajores Celo testnet, 

STEP TWO:
Once connected, users should proceed and click the “Request Tokens” button which would prompt a metamask wallet (preferred)  to authorise the dispense of CENUN tokens to their wallet.

STEP THREE:
After dispensing tokens, users will be able to see CENUN tokens in their wallet and the token balance being displayed on the dashboard. Users can now go ahead and stake the amount of CENUN tokens they want to stake.

STEP FOUR:
After staking, users will see their staked balance and their wallet holding token balance will be updated and also reflected on the dapp. Users can now go ahead to the next phase which is Renegade Hydrate

STEP FIVE:
Users should click the Renegade Hydrate button and then on the dashboard, they can use any amount of staked CENUN to claim reCENUN tokens (Cenun governance token). Which is in distributed in a ratio of 1 Staked Cenun = 0.001 reCenun tokens. User can finally disconnect wallet once done testing.
